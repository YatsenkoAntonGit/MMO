All present Macs support the use of \\n32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw \\nallows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-\\nbit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y \\nindependently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 \\ndpi [12\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including \\nautosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz \\nvertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser \\nAug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and \\nIIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit \\ncolor (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  \\nTo keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display \\ncapability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit \\ncolor.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX \\nwill change this.\\nIn addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one \\nmonitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same \\nthing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree \\nof overlap of the pictures.\\nVRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac\\'s handling of \\n built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit\\n color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. \\nSound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became \\n standard with the SE/30.\\n\\nIBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system \\ninteracts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing \\nBIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation\\nof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program \\ninteraction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer \\nJawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a \\nstandard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is \\nactually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like \\nMac\\'s QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, \\nespecially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present \\nthings are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver \\nand monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, \\nand monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with \\nan IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \\n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \\nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \\nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \\nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \\nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \\n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \\n the most commonly used.

As such, with each manufacturer \\n using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating\\n as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a \\n standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things\\n are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \\n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \\n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \\n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \\n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \\n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].

SCSI-2 is fully\\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \\n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.

Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \"fast SCSI-1\". \\n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \\n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \\n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \\n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \\n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \\n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \\n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \\n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\\n\\nMac\\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \\n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \\n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \\n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \\n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \\n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \\n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \\n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \\n size are used then the memory is \\'interleaved\\' across the two SIMMs resulting \\n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \\nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \\n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU\\'s MHz.  \\n Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU\\'s MHz {Q700/900 & C650: \\n 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with\\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \\n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \\n through put down.\\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \\n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \\n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet \\n to DMA.\\nNuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:\\n ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.

In development.\\nCPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  \\n Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at \\n the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to \\n dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each \\n NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with \\n 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.\\n\\nIBM\\nMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-\\nlike SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.\\n\\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: \\nMFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited\\n only used with smaller [² 60mb] hard drives.\\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \\n Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.\\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \\n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. \\nESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface\\n ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in\\n many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of\\n hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. \\n\\nBUS interfaces\\n{New \\'plug and play\\' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working \\nwith old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}\\nISA\\n 8 & 16-bit interfaces common.

Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).\\nEISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}\\n 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.

This allows \\nApple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, \\nmenu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require \\nclone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires \\naccess to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM \\nchips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support \\ninterface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS \\nhas the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and \\ntherefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control \\nover hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with \\nsome of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a \\ntotally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon \\nWtte).\\n6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, \\n cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  \\n Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program \\n interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd].

Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present \\n machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is \\n both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit \\n mode and on older machines requires the \\'Mode 32\\' extension.  Apple\\'s last \\n \\'free\\' OS.\\n7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than \\n 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode \\n on older machines it requires the \\'Mode 32\\' or \\'32-Bit Enabler\\' extension. \\n Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades\\n {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.\\n [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system \\n fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any \\n RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all \\n fonts from the system file.]\\nA/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and \\n a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS \\n is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac \\n ROMs.  Price: $709.\\nNote: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats \\nincluding the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and \\nDCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards \\'snd\\' \\nand AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most \\nstill play.\\n\\nIBM\\n Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for \\nprogrammers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  \\nSince hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, \\nwhat little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  \\nThis results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or \\nEPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to \\nbetter optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which \\nis harder with a ROM based system due to the \\'patches\\' needed.  In addition it \\nreduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware \\nsupport is needed.\\nSide note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing \\nall feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing \\nits Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\"Undocumented Windows\") and \\n\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to \\nabort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 \\n#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC \\njudicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no \\naction.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of \\nchoosing a new member or whole new council.

Novell Netware is the biggest, \\n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \\noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it\\'s also more \\ncomplex to set up and manage.

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\",\n",

Either way, the most \\nmemory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether \\nthe Portable is Backlit or not.

All the discussion on the net indicates that\\n\\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\\n\\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \\n\\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\\n\\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\\n\\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\\n\\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\\n\\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\\n\\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\\n\\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the \"A\" is better than \"B\" \\n\\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\\n\\tI am looking forward to being able to \"LOADHIGH\" the DD sw.  That\\n\\thas been an annoyance.\\n\\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\\n\\teffort to upgrade.\\n\\nJust my $.02 ...\\n\\nRegards,\\nMark Bagdy\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nBuddy,\\n\\nI got the same mailer.

DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\\n~197Mb free.

Since they aren\\'t fixed in position on their\\nstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different\\nposition. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of\\ncontact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing\\nthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the\\nball, not the center cylindrical area.\\n\\nI\\'ve done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but\\nneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our\\noffice\\'s PB170s, and while there isn\\'t as much latitude for movement, one\\ncould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might\\nhelp.\\n\\nI would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If\\nyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl \\nalcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.\\n\\nIf you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see\\nif it is actually causing the axle to spin. \\n\\nIf all this still doesn\\'t solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(\\nIt could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be\\nnecessary.

(if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit\\nI mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC\\n(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the\\nbundle (at least two of their sales people couldn\\'t give me a straight\\nanswer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).\\n\\nOther questions:\\n\\n- Excuse my ignorance, but is \"Texel\" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM\\n  market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?\\n\\n- Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the\\n  TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)\\n\\nAlternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my\\nuses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff,\\neducational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end\\nTA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something\\nelse useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.\\n\\nBasically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED\\nthese kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably\\ndirectly to the email address below.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nKoji\\n\\n                            2\\n                         _/\\n  ~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  |        _/        _/    |                  Koji Kodama                  |\\n  |  by   _/      _/       |              Nippon Motorola Ltd.             |\\n  |      _/    _/          |            ryvg90@email.sps.mot.com           |\\n  |     _/  _/             |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\\n  |    _/_/  _/            |      NOTE: The opinions expressed herein      |\\n  |   _/      _/           |   are mine, and do not reflect the opinions   |\\n  |  _/        _/          |or policies of Motorola Inc. or its affiliates.|\\n  ~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                 _/_/_/\\n',\n",

You can use this command:\\n\\t\\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd.

If you give \\na resource specification like this:\\n\\t\\txterm*geometry: 80x24\\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \\nBut its popup menus don\\'t; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\\n\\t\\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\\n\\n\\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \\nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \\nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \\n\\t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \\nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\\n\\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\\nadapted to do this.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\\n\\n\\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \\nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \\napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\n\\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open Windows, and you also \\nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \\nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \\napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \\nXtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\\n                application\\'s class name.\\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n        %t      The territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n        %c      The codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is \\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \\nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\n\\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \\nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \\nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set \\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \\ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n\\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \\nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \\nMyterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so you can run the application\\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\\n%S are useless.\\n\\n\\tWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization \\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\n\\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \\ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\n\\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n\\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\\nthis batch of default settings.)\\n\\n\\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n\\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory \\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \\nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\n\\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \\nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \\ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \\nby a slash.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\\n\\nThe answer lies in changing xdm\\'s xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \\nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \\n\\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \\nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \\n\\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\\n\\t#!/bin/sh\\n\\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;\\nor you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and\\nsource it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,\\nif you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your \\n.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting\\nyour .xsession file off with \"#!/bin/csh\". \\n\\tIf this doesn\\'t work, also try starting off with:\\n\\t\\t#!/bin/sh\\n\\t\\t# Reset path:\\n\\t\\tPATH=`csh -c \\'echo $PATH\\'` ; export PATH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?\\n\\n\\tThere are several ways to avoid having to do a \"setenv DISPLAY ...\"\\nwhenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.\\n\\tOne solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It \\nincludes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and\\nxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.\\nA more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.\\n\\tOne solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse\\n(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from\\n132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and\\n$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then \\npropagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\\n\\t\\teval `xrlogind`\\nwhere xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special \\nformat it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to \\nrecreate the environment variables.

Xfed is \\navailable for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], \\npossibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z.

(You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \\nthe path.)\\n\\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\\n\\t\\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\\n\\t\\t\\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\\n\\t\\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\\n\\n\\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\\n\\n-- Is the font directory you\\'re specifying readable from the SERVER\\'s file\\n   system?  Remember, it\\'s the server, not the client, which interprets your\\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\\n\\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you\\'re running an MIT server\\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can\\'t find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you\\'re\\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can\\'t find\\n   it, run bldfamily(1).)\\n\\n-- If you\\'re in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a\\n   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for\\n   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you\\'re using.\\n   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won\\'t work for\\n   Open Windows.

The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the \\nsame depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because \\nof this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since \\nthere is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, \\nneither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap \\nconverter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a \\nresource.

If there is too much technical   baggage (which\\nI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do\\nthis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as\\nstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades.

Although it is not \\nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \\nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\\n\\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \\nobvious.\\n\\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\\nR5 versions are different.\\n\\n\\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\\n\\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\\nusing Imake to build X\\n\\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\\n\\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes\\' R3/R4\\nguide to imake.\\n\\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\\nFulton on an early version of Imake\\n\\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \\nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \\nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript).

An earlier \\nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \\nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \\ntemplate and configuration files.

Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \\nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \\nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\\n\\n\\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \\nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \\nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \\ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \\nlibraries.\\n\\n[from John B.

Apparently, you can\\'t share a function that \\nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \\n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \\nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \\nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\\nbe called.\\n\\n\\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \\n\\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \\nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif\\'s 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \\nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\\n\\t2) alternatively, your program doesn\\'t need any Xt functions and is\\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \\nprogram.

In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\\ncalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\\ncan use something like the following:\\n\\n        XWMHints wmhints;\\n        ...\\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\\n        wmhints.input = True;\\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\\n\\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \\nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don\\'t have\\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource \\'*input:True\\'.\\n\\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \\nthis done. \\n\\n\\tIf you are using Sun\\'s OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren\\'t ICCCM-compliant.\\n\\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\\n\\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\\n\\n\\tYou can\\'t reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\\nspoofed in any case. \\n\\tFor most cases, you shouldn\\'t care which window manager is running, so \\nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \\nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \\nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \\nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm\\'s push-pin menus) in order\\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \\nmanager\\'s functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\\n\\t\\n\\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \\nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \\nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \\ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \\napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just \\nthis one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \\nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \\ndistributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \\nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \\nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \\nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \\t[3/90]\\n\\n\\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \\nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \\nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z.

Your code may be doing something like this:\\n\\t{\\n\\tArg args[3];\\n\\tint i;\\n\\tint sensitive;\\t\\t/* oops; wrong data type */\\n\\ti=0;\\n\\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\\n\\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\\n\\t...\\n\\t}\\n\\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \\ndeclaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem \\ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \\nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \\nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget\\'s man page.\\n[11/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 117)  Why don\\'t XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re probably trying to use these functions from application code.\\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \\nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \\nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \\nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\\n\\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions\\' being called, your\\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \\nwidgets\\' data becoming corrupted.\\n\\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \\navoided; they shouldn\\'t be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 118)  Why isn\\'t there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\\n\\n\\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\\nthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\\nWhat should happen to the widget\\'s children? And by the time such semantics are\\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \\nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \\nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \\ncreating a new widget.\\n\\n\\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDavid B.

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines?

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

It\\'s been on all weekend and it hardly\\neven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a \\nlot to do with it. \\n\\n   It\\'s up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I\\'ve also read about\\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \\nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \"maps\" the other\\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \"cd\" to these\\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It\\'s almost like a\\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\\nIt\\'s not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \\npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \\n\\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\\n\\n  So, I\\'m glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I\\'m glad it\\nwas me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn\\n\\n\\n-- \\nJohn Gayman, WA3WBU \\nUUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john\\nPacket: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH \\n',\n",

I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same\\ntime, with no overlap; and since two windows aren\\'t enough, I have\\nother xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.\\n\\nIn case you\\'re not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here\\'s a crude\\npicture:\\n\\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\\n |\\n |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+\\n |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +\\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\\n |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +\\n |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C\\'s title  +\\n |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +\\n |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+\\n |\\n ====================== Figure 1 ====================================\\n\\nSqueezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,\\nwith easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really\\nneed, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.\\n\\nThe only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it\\nis configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit\\nthat file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and\\ntime-consuming.\\n\\nTherefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }\\nfunctions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click\\nof a button, you can change this:\\n\\n    +---------+\\n    + title A +\\n    +------------------------+\\n    +   this is the          +\\n    +     body of the        +\\n    +      window, window A  +\\n    +------------------------+\\n\\nto this:\\n\\n                   +---------+\\n                   + title A +\\n    +------------------------+\\n    +   this is the          +\\n    +     body of the        +\\n    +      window, window A  +\\n    +------------------------+\\n\\n ===============\\n\\nOkay.

Lewis)\\nSubject: comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 3/5\\nSummary: useful information about the X Window System\\nReply-To: faq%craft@uunet.uu.net (X FAQ maintenance address)\\nOrganization: VISUAL, Inc.\\nExpires: Sun, 2 May 1993 00:00:00 GMT\\nLines: 998\\n\\nArchive-name: x-faq/part3\\nLast-modified: 1993/04/04\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5?\\n\\n\\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\\n\\n\\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \\nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \\ntheir source distributions of X11.\\n\\n\\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \\n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\\n\\t\\tsend fixes #\\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\\n\\n\\tHere are a few complications:\\n\\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \\n\"5d\" separately\\n\\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \\nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn\\'t work with Solaris]\\n\\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\\n\\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\\n\\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\\n\\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \\npreviously was optional\\n\\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\\nby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\\n\\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \\nit a request, and it mails back the response.\\n\\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \\nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \\nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \\nof the message.\\n\\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \\nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \\nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \\nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\\n\\n\\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \\nmore detailed version of this help file.\\n\\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \\nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \\nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \\nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \\nrequests an index cannot request data.\\n\\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \\nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\\n\\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \\nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \\namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \\nday\\'s quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \\nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day\\'s quota, it sends the requests out \\nshortest-first.\\n\\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \\nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won\\'t get any response.  If \\nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\\nor\\n        path bar!foo!frotz\\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If \\nyour mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to \\n{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.\\n\\n[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  60)!

They\\nalso give an example of how to \"emulate\" strokeadjust in PostScript\\nenvironments where it is absent.\\n\\nThe suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints\\nof a line using the following formula for each coordinate:\\n\\n\\tnew_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25\\n\\t\\nDoing this we end up with all coordinates ending in \".25\".  From\\nreading I thought that what they might actually do is:\\n\\n\\tnew_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25\\n\\t\\nThis results in all the coordinates ending in either \"0.25\" or \"0.75\" \\nwhichever is closer.\\n\\nBy doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that\\nneither of these is what DPS really uses.

The opinions expressed are those\\n              of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle.\\nLines: 41\\n\\n\\nAs the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  \\nlate.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \\nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \\ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \\napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \\nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \\nneed to re-boot.\\n\\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \\nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \\nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \\n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \\nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \\nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \\nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \\nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \\nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \\nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \\nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\\n\\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \\nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \\nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \\n\\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \\nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \\nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \\nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\\n\\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \\ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \\nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  \\nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  \\ngdi.exe.\\n\\nAny help is truly appreciated.....\\n\\n-Eric\\n\\nebosco@us.oracle.com\\n\",\n",

I tried it with another keyboard, using\\nthe same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.\\nThe shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked\\nthe dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell\\nme if it works.\\n             \\nI am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for\\ninspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they\\nhave a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the\\ninspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the          \\nkeyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info\\nfrom them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them\\nthe keyboard and their technical support line is not toll free. tell me\\nif you have a similar experience with them.\\n\\n-David Mirsky\\nmirsky@gnu.ai.mit.edu\\n\",\n",

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas\\nthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700\\nupgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21\"\\nwith 8 bit depth and up to 16\" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It\\nalso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which\\nmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.\\n\\n  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you\\'re\\nbetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an\\naccelerator.\\n\\nPaul\\n',\n",

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the\\nprocess of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 \\nand C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent\\nGraphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through \\nJune 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with \\nansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge \\ntape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.\\n \\nX Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:\\n \\n1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types\\n   available through a large collection of X resources.\\n2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.\\n3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.\\n4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.\\n5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget \\n   library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar \\n   to X programmers.\\n6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge\\'s UIM/X product.\\n   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical\\n   layout of an application.\\n \\nC Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:\\n \\n1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library\\n   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C\\n   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.\\n2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse \\n   interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control\\n   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.\\n3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \"two-call\"\\n   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available\\n   with minimal programming effort.\\n4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling\\n   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot\\n   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can \\n   control the event loop.\\n \\nIf anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please\\ncontact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call\\n713-279-1066.\\n \\n \\n-- \\nJaclyn Brandt\\njbrandt@NeoSoft.com\\n--\\n',\n",

When the computer is\\npowered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given\\nthe \"no disk to boot from\" icon.  However, upon turing the\\ncomputer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  \\nFurthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot \\nbutton the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power\\noff and on always works.\\n\\nThis problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before\\nit often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.\\n\\nDoes anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how\\nit can be fixed?\\n\\nI\\'m wondering if it\\'s getting old and requires more time to \\n\"come up to speed\" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that\\nallows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before \\ntrying to access the HD?\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\nAltan J.

Reason is that a font with 3000 characters\\nis very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy\\nprice in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there\\nis only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')\\n\\n\\tFor instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows\\n\\tchar set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font\\n\\tis brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac\\n\\tchar set. \\t\\n\\nYes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is\\na superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.\\n\\nThe question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example,\\nyou cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a\\nfont may very well have them.\\n\\nANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a\\nnew Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow\\nyou do this.

It is incorporated as a part of \\nwin.com.\\n\\tTo make a new win.com, you have to concatinate three files together, \\nusing the /b option for a binary concatonation.  I beleive it is\\n\\ncopy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle mywin.com\\n\\nMake sure you backup your win.com file in anotehr directory before you do this \\n-- I absent-mindedly typed win.com instead of mywin.com and had to resinstall \\nWindows!\\n\\tAnyway, substitute whatever .RLE file you want.  The win.cnf has the \\ninfo needed to start Windows (think of it as a bootstrap) and vgalogo.vga has \\nvideo information.  Just make sure that the .RLE file doesn\\'t tip the whole \\nCOM file size over the 64k limit of a .COM file!\\n\\tSo anyway, I use mywin.com to startup MS Windows.

I have\\ncome across a few that look good:\\n\\n  Zapp 1.1 from Inmark\\n  Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software\\n  C++/Views from Liant\\n  Win++ from Blaise\\n\\nSome considerations I'm using:\\n\\n  Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and\\nintuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very \\nimportant.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows\\nprogramming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with\\nthe native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the\\nsake of changing the API, are valuable.\\n\\n  Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the\\nmemory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less\\nimportant. \\n\\n  We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch\\ncomponents from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff\\n (allocators etc...).

The directory entry, the FAT chain,\\nand the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined\\nnotebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.\\n\\nThe directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,\\nand first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that\\'s not\\nimportant right now.\\n\\nThe File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find\\nthe actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the\\nnumber is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it\\nholds a \"magic\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad\\n(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster\\ncontains the next section of the file.\\n\\nThe data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.\\nThe data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is\\ndoled out in \"chunks\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster\\nis 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.\\n\\nTo read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the\\nstarting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.\\nNext, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will\\ntell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.\\nNaturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump\\naround and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a\\ntime, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker\\nwhich says it\\'s the last cluster in the file.\\n\\nCHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of\\nthe directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into\\nsubmission.  It doesn\\'t have any intelligence, so you have to\\ndouble-check anything it \"fixes\".\\n\\nNow let\\'s do a bit of a post-mortem:\\n\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\CVPIC.EXE\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\VPIC.TXT\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\VIDEO7.CFG\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\ORCPRO2.CFG\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\VGA.CFG\\n>C:\\\\GAME\\\\GOOSE\\\\BIRD2.X\\n>C:\\\\WINMISC\\\\ADV21\\\\WINADV.EXE\\n>   Allocation error, size adjusted\\n\\nAll of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don\\'t match\\nthe size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter\\nthe directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the\\ndirectory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.\\nBut CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,\\nobviously, are made up.))\\n\\n>   316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains.\\n>    647168 bytes disk space would be freed\\n\\nDisk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached\\nto any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these\\n\"lost chains\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK\\nthrough FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell\\nCHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply\\nbe marked \"available\" in the FAT.\\n\\n\\n>C:\\\\GFX\\\\VPIC46\\\\CVPIC.EXE\\n>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133\\n\\n...\\n\\n>C:\\\\386SPART.PAR\\n>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133\\n\\nThese files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,\\none of them (at least) must be wrong.  It\\'s interesting to note that\\nC:\\\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...\\n\\nTo fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.\\nThis will \"fix\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.\\nNow delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to\\nassemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \"Missing pieces\" are\\nlikely to be found in those \"lost chains\" at the top...)\\n\\n>  42366976 bytes total disk space\\n>   3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files\\n>    153600 bytes in 67 directories\\n>  36042752 bytes in 1496 user files\\n>   1564672 bytes available on disk\\n\\nYour disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of\\nthe problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an\\namount which exceeded available disk space...\\n\\nIn any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.\\nThere are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage\\nafter something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the\\nproblem occurs.

Currently I have  \\n8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  \\nboth banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  \\nof running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  \\nthat more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  \\ncan see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  \\n$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  \\nthe entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  \\nthe machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  \\navoid...\\n\\nSo my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  \\nwell with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  \\n$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  \\ndo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \\nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  \\nISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  \\nprobably all of this is just wishful thinking...

Schmidt)\\nSubject: outlining of spline surface\\nKeywords: spline rasterization\\nLines: 38\\n\\n\\n\\tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\\narea.\\n\\n-Thanks\\n',\n",

Some\\n>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel\\n>(the first is preferrable, of course)\\n\\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\\n\\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\\nbecause\\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\\nscanning\\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\\nsome machines).\\n\\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\\nonce\\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\\nwant to\\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\\nthe\\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\\nof\\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\\nwant\\nto make stereo sound.\\n\\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\\nthe\\nIBM don\\'t want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\\n\\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\\nhardware,\\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\\nworks.\\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\\n700/900/950\\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\\nonly.\\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\\nspecification,\\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\\n\\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\\n\\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn\\'t really related.\\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\\nmachine\\nyou have.\\n\\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\\n>Lemmings\\n>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)\\n>Glider 4.0\\n>OIDS\\nand also\\nHellcats,\\nSuper Tetris\\nOxyd\\n(and many more, these are just what I\\'ve tested)\\n\\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\\n\\n\\nOther games you list:\\n>Armor Alley\\n>Spectre\\n>Spaceward Ho!\\nand also\\nPGA Tour Golf\\nCivilization\\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\\n\\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\\n\\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON\\'T CHEAT!\\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\\ndo,\\nbut I\\'m going say it anyway.\\nStop cheating on sound!\\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\\nis about to end.\\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\\nwork\\neven better soon, so use it.\\n\\nIn conclusion:\\nTo Doug, it isn\\'t a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\\nTo Jon, it isn\\'t a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\\nsound\\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\\nhardware.\\n\\n\\nHave fun.\\n\\nDisclaimer number 1:\\nI don\\'t work on sound here at Apple, I\\'m just pretty well informed.\\nSo don\\'t write me with sound questions.\\n\\nDisclaimer number 2:\\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like \"the grace period is about\\nto end\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\\nallowed to say anything like that.

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and\\nthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.\\n\\tIn general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating \\nindependently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other\\ncallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be \\nregistered can explicitly call other functions necessary.\\n\\n[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 122)  Why doesn\\'t XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?\\n\\n\\tXtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving\\ndangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not \\nactually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?\\n\\t\\n\\tIt is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,\\nwhich has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer\\nis set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \"yes\" answer, the code drops\\nout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: \\n\\n\\tvoid quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tint             answer;\\n\\t\\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Really Quit?\");\\n\\t\\tif (RET_YES == answer)\\n\\t\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Are You Really Positive?\");\\n\\t\\t\\tif (RET_YES == answer)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texit(0);\\n                }\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tA more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether \\nto overwrite it.\\n\\tThis is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and\\nwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the\\ncalling function.

Using a window id of NULL (\"no window\") could \\ncreate the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() \\nbefore attempting to use the window associated with a widget. \\n\\tNote that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, \\nbut that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also \\nwait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?\\n\\nThe BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of \\nthe screen.

(It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the \\nuser enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual \\ndesktop.) Substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code \\nshould work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):\\n\\n     unsigned long valuemask;\\n     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\\n\\n     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */\\n     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;\\n     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |\\n         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);\\n     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);\\n\\n     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by\\n        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */\\n     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,\\n         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,\\n         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);\\n\\nwhere the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,\\nparticularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than\\n32767.\\n\\nWhen you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to\\nnormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse\\nevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not\\nhave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.\\n\\nIn addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor \\nresource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the\\ncursor without blocking pointer events.\\n\\n[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller \\n(argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\\n\\n\\tAn X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which \\ncontinue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its \\nchildren are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X \\nconnection to the display. \\n\\tWhat you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \\n\\t\\tclose (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));\\nto close the file-descriptor in the display information.

If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which \\nmight be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave\\nthe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points\\nout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to\\nXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be\\ncalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by \\nXlib or Xt functions.\\n\\tYou can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt\\nhandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which\\nhas previously been added.\\n\\n\\tNote: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\\'Reilly \\nVolume 6 are in error.\\n\\n[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse \\n(converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 131)  What are these \"Xlib sequence lost\" errors?\\n\\n\\tYou may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error \\nhandler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or \\nXlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn\\'t be doing in any case. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input \\nboth from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but \\nwhich operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or \\nthe other file descriptor.\\n\\tA solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,\\nuse XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be \\ncalled every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your \\nprogram\\'s attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt \\ncallback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only\\nnon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\\n\\tMost input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an \\ninput handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\\n\\tBe careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.\\nYou will find that the function is called even when there isn\\'t input pending.\\nXtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is \\ncalled whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is\\nnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always \\nready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning\\nand read data you\\'ve read before.  The result is that your function will almost\\nalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the \\ntype of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your \\nfunction to test whether there is new data:\\n\\t     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;\\nBut, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a \\nbusy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting \\na timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.\\n\\n[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;\\nOllie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?\\n\\n\\tYou can do this using XSendEvent(); it\\'s likely that you\\'re not setting\\nthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget\\nwhich should receive the event.\\n\\t If you\\'re sending events to your own application, then you can use \\nXtDispatchEvent() instead.

Unless you\\'re willing to depend on some sort of\\nextension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,\\neither by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games\\nwith the colormap and changing the color of the contents.\\n\\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?\\n\\n\\tUsers of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help \\nget notification of double-clicking.\\n\\tThere is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the \\nprotocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do \\nclient-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer\\nactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you \\nhave to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish \\nimplementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of \\nthe X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.\\n\\tNote that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click\\nbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case\\nin your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise\\ncheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should\\nbe the single-click action or the double-click action.\\n\\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?\\n\\t\\n\\tXlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics \\ncapabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics\\nlibraries.\\n\\tYour only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to\\nrender the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \"by \\nhand\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via \\nXPutImage(); more specifically:\\n\\t1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.\\n\\t2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).\\n\\t3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.\\n\\t4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where \\n\\t\\ta = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)\\n\\t\\tb = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\\n\\t5) render I2\\n\\tNote that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose\\nbits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.\\n\\tThe high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X \\nalso permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,\\nalthough most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the\\nsame fonts that would be found on a printer.\\n\\tIn addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font\\non it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some\\npredefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each\\nglyph.\\n\\n[courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu), Eric Taylor \\n(etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;\\nLiam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]\\n\\n\\tInterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for\\nrendering rotated fonts in X.

It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.\\nThere are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and\\nthe software.  THAT IS IT.\\nLet us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.\\n\\nSCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}\\n asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}\\n synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a\\n rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}\\n\\nSCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from\\n SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs\\n this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers\\n AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the \\n slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode \\n 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous\\n mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}\\n\\nSCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things\\n over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the\\n machine and the external device.\\n Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver\\n software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.\\n Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.\\n\\nSCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this\\n requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING\\n devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY\\n expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts\\n \\n\\nAs I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the \\ncontroler chip, and the port.

Windows will use a swap file\\nlarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft\\nWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information\\nthat the general public might not be aware of.

I\\'ll quote the information\\n\\n  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you\\n  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything\\n  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we\\n  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount\\n  of RAM on your machine.\\n\\nSo as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You\\nprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only\\ntelling you what little he knew.\\n\\nBe that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the\\nopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren\\'t actually\\nincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and\\noptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer\\nyou HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick\\nup Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.\\nThat is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You\\ncould also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself\\nI sprang for Word.\\n\\nWell, hope that was helpful to someone.

Changing your\\nown applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can\\njust XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately\\nyou can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with\\nicons which your application doesn't specifically own.\\n\\nIn my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in \\nmy icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the\\nicon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes\\nany difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.\\n\\nThanks -\\nScott :)\\n\",\n",

There are\\na lot of jumpers on it that we don\\'t know what they are for.\\n\\nThird, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things to\\nwork and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy was\\ntroublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset on\\nthe MacPlus the drive disappears.

For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS\\nand Sun (and other vendor\\'s) VME systems.\\n\\nThat said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display\\non a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port\\nwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say\\nyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could\\nput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.\\nYou could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to\\nmix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could\\nhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,\\nor 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any\\ncombination.\\n\\nBecause of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use\\nof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different\\nin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.\\n\\nThe reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12\\nscreens in a display. As it so happens, there\\'s a define in the server\\nthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,\\nMAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,\\nthis is 12.\\n\\nAs such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.\\nX server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X\\nI\\'m sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is\\nnot the case.\\n\\nWe just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more.

For example, incorrect\\nEnglish constructs such as \"its raining\" or \"it\\'s window id\" annoy me.\\nHowever, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way\\nthings really are in the world.

In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,\\nsnappy, descriptive title (\"X\" is positively obscure) will help\\nwhen dealing with the average punter (it\\'s sad - I thought I was a\\nsoftware engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become\\npopularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should\\nbe called \"Microsoft Windows\" or \"the Microsoft Window System\" or\\nhow about just plain \"Microsoft\"!\\n\\nTo summarise (or should that be \"summarize\") the point of this message:\\nI think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than\\nworrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system\\n(or should that be \"windowing system\"). Whatever gets recognised is\\nfine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what\\ntrade papers say.

How much VRAM does it have?\\nOn the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16\" monitor, which is capable\\nof 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.\\n\\nI would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that\\nboth machines have 16-bit color capability.\\nIs it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?\\nFrom the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have\\n16-bit color, is that correct?\\n\\nBonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide?

Can do simple display,\\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\\n  [PC and Macs]\\n\\nLabVIEW 2\\n---------\\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\\n\\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\\n\\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\\n---------------------------\\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\\n  hues, color range and mask.\\n\\nImageStudio: Don\\'t know...\\n\\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\\n\\nDapple Systems\\n--------------\\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\\n\\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W.

One such feature allows the user to\\n  select part of an image simply by \"painting\" it. A new polyline\\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator \"paint\" with a selected portion\\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\\n  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as\\n  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.\\n\\n  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Documentation (PostScript mostly)\\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\\n  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\\n     There is currently a project - \"AIPS++\" - underway to rewrite the\\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\\n  Australia to name a few. \\n\\nLABOimage\\n---------\\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It\\'s written in C, and currently\\n  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \\n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Been around for\\n  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000\\n  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display\"\\n\\nHIPS\\n----\\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\\'s Image Processing System)\\n\\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I\\'d like to\\nask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a\\nmarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at\\nthis point.  Well, my group\\'s plan is to market a \"full page\" monitor\\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology\\'s PaletteBook\\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR \"full\" height. \\nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\\napplications, color screens aren\\'t really a neccessity.  We could\\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\\n\\nNow, please don\\'t write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\\nneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me\\nvia email and let me know:\\n1. If you would consider buying a \"full page\" laptop screen\\n2. How much you would be willing to pay for it\\n3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea\\n\\nAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,\\nbut who knows!), please send me some.\\n\\nThanks in advance!!!\\n\\n-Mike\\n',\n",

They all accept a file as a command line \\nparameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this\\neasily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so\\nthat it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type \\nin the file name).  \\n\\nProblems are:\\n\\n\\t1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it\\nwould be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the\\nfile manager.\\n\\t\\n    and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried \\nseveral directory levels deep.\\n\\n\\tIf anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some\\nother way to handle this, I'd appreciate it.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nTim\\n-- \\n\\tThe Net isn't organized enough to be considered an anarchy\\n\\n  reczek@autarch.acsu.buffalo.edu\\n\",\n",

The picture either tilts\\nsideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some\\n\"spiky\" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing\\npull-downs etc.\\nWith the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only\\nsense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a\\npicture clear enough to shut down from menu...\\nWith the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but\\nsometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely\\nlost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.\\n\\nI know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but\\nwith the one provided by NEC... where\\'s the source of this interference?\\n\\nI\\'ll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can,\\nat least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin\\nassignment for NEC 3D.\\nI am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and\\nisolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be\\narranged, especially syncs and groundings.\\n\\nYes, I have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works\\nperfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and\\nalso Atari 71Hz monochrome, which I am using now with it.\\n\\nHere are the pinouts & stuff:\\n\\n15 pin mini D-sub (NEC 3D)\\t\\t15 pin D-sub (Mac, at least Quadra)\\n\\n1  Red Video\\t\\t\\t\\t1  Red GND\\n2  Green Video\\t\\t\\t\\t2  Red Video\\n3  Blue Video\\t\\t\\t\\t3  Composite Sync\\n4  GND\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4  Sense 0\\n5  GND\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5  Green Video\\n6  Red GND\\t\\t\\t\\t6  Green GND\\n7  Green GND\\t\\t\\t\\t7  Sense 1\\n8  Blue GND\\t\\t\\t\\t8  NC\\n9  NC\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t9  Blue Video\\n10 GND\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t10 Sense 2\\n11 GND\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t11 C.Sync & V.Sync GND\\n12 NC\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t12 V.Sync\\n13 H.Sync\\t\\t\\t\\t13 Blue GND\\n14 V.Sync\\t\\t\\t\\t14 H.Sync GND\\n15 NC\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t15 H.Sync\\nSHELL GND\\t\\t\\t\\tSHELL GND\\n\\n\\n\\nConnection suggested by Apple for VGA/SVGA, sense pins changed to\\nemulate Apple 13\" with Multisync (my self-made adapter)\\n\\nMultisync (15pin mini D-sub)\\tMac (15pin D-sub)\\n\\t  \\n\\t  1  ---------------------- 2\\n\\t  2  ---------------------- 5\\n\\t  3  ---------------------- 9\\n\\t  6  ---------------------- 1\\n\\t  7  ---------------------- 6\\n\\t  8  ---------------------- 13\\n\\t  10 ---------------------- 14\\n\\t  13 ---------------------- 15\\n\\t  14 ---------------------- 12\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    4 (sense0) grounded to 11 (sync GND)\\n\\n\\nConnection measured from an adapter to make NEC 3FG/4FG \\nemulate Apple 13\" (adapter provided by NEC representative)\\n\\n\\tNEC (15 mini)   \\tMac (15)\\n\\n\\t1   ----------------------- 2\\n\\t2   ----------------------- 5\\n\\t3   ----------------------- 9\\n\\t4   ----------------------- SHELL GND, 1, 4, 6, 13\\n\\t5   ----------------------- same as above\\n\\t6   ----------------------- same...\\n\\t7   ----------------------- same...\\n\\t8   ----------------------- same...\\n\\t10  ----------------------- same...\\n\\t11  ----------------------- same...\\n\\t13  ----------------------- 3\\n\\t14    * Not Connected! *\\n\\t\\n\\nWell, I am waiting for your solutions...\\n\\nAnd thanks!\\n\\n--\\nJartsu\\n',\n",

Asante EN/SC\\nadapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm.

The Mac\\ntests memory, etc. Just before the \"happy Mac face\" normally shows up, the\\npower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use\\nthe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the\\nAsante box pretty much unusable.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn\\non the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn\\'t get noticed\\nduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter\\nworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

To shorten development time, I\\nused TeleUSE\\'s TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\\ndescribed above should work.\\n\\n-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)\\n',\n",

Well,\\nthink again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple\\ncomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:\\n\\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple\\'s attention a problem with\\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \"stick\" in\\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\\nBCGA65431. You\\'ll recognize this \"sticky button\" symptom immediately if you\\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it\\'s not subtle.\\n\\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \\nsuggested that people contact Apple\\'s Customer Assistance Center directly\\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\\n\\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\\nit worth Apple\\'s while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don\\'t assume you\\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\\n\\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\\n\\nIf the number isn\\'t toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\\nthe details of your case, including your mouse\\'s serial number.  Be firm.\\n\\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don\\'t send mail to\\nme or post yet another \"sticky-button\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\\nwill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy\\nto stone-wall on this issue, don\\'t expect them to offer support when the\\nnext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.\\n\\n-- Bill Sloan\\n',\n",

It is an S3\\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn\\'t just say \"Buy the memory\\nfrom us\" or something like that.)\\n\\n\\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn\\'t have bothered.  I\\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\\nOrchid\\'s software developers are busy with other projects.\"\\n\\n\\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I\\'d love to\\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\\nsystem and it\\'s not so easy to exchange these things unless they\\'re\\nbroken.\\n\\n\\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \"less\\nbusy\".  If the magazines are to believed, I\\'ve only seen one s3 86c805\\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\\n\\n\\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\\n\\nThanks.\\ndonyee@athena.mit.edu\\n',\n",

You can generally tell the difference\\njust by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,\\nit's probably a software cursor.

If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of\\ncaked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully\\nscrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*\\nYou do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.\\nPut the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  \\n\\nI clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom\\nis that when you move the mouse, it seems to \"click\" along.  If this\\ndoesn\\'t solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.

Oh, which brings me to another point:\\nif your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is \\nstreaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice\\nthat it will stop working.

Installing second IDE drive\\nOrganization: SURAnet, College Park, MD, USA, NA, Earth, Milky Way\\nLines: 44\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: azathoth.sura.net\\n\\nRecently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,\\nI can look up the model number if it\\'s important) and I\\'ve been\\ntrying to help him install it.  [I\\'ve got a vested interest, since\\nmy machine\\'s busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]\\nHe already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number\\nbut I can find out.)\\n\\nAnyway, I can\\'t seem to get the bloody thing up.  I\\'ve managed to get\\none or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both\\nat the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -\\nnever gets past the system test.  The IDE controller\\'s instruction\\nsheet says it supports two drives; I think I\\'ve configured the CMOS\\ncorrectly; the power\\'s plugged in properly; I even learned about the\\nmaster/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn\\'t\\nknow PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers\\nproperly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).\\n\\nThe only thing I can think of is maybe I\\'m doing the cabling wrong.  I\\'ve\\ntried several combinations:\\n\\ncontroller - master - slave\\ncontroller - slave - master\\nmaster - controller - slave\\n\\nNone of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can\\'t think of any others.\\n\\nAnother possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into\\ntwo seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \"C: drive\" and \"D:\\ndrive\" setup info rather than \"drive 1\" and \"drive 2\" like most others\\nI\\'ve seen.  Could this be confusing things?\\n\\nSo, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some\\ninfo for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper\\nabout the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it\\'s one\\nof those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so\\nit looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!\\n\\nMany, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have\\ntwo papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!  Help!\\n-- \\n-----------------------\\nWilliam Barnes\\t\\tSURAnet Operations\\nwbarnes@sura.net\\t(301) 982-4600 voice  (301) 982-4605 fax\\nDisclaimer:  I don\\'t speak for SURAnet and they don\\'t speak for me.\\n',\n",

The specs I would like to have is:\\n\\n   * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD\\n   * SCSI(2) Interface\\n   * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B\\n   * Does not need any caddies\\n   * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible)\\n   * Double Speeded\\n\\n  I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition,\\n  so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions\\n  are sorted by my priority.\\n  I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it DOES satisfy\\n  almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know\\n  the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these\\n  NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible\\n  with 1542B adapter.\\n  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.\\n\\nThanks in advance,\\nKobayashi,Masaoki\\n(masaoki@tky.hp.com)\\n',\n",

I have a IIsi that came\\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\\n \\nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\\nover two months.\\n\\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don\\'t have a spare\\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\\nshorts or bad connections.\\n\\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn\\'t word so what\\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn\\'t work, my original cable is not\\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\\n\\nHaving done all that, I couldn\\'t be bothered to check the dev notes for\\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\\nday. \\n\\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID\\'s of\\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\\n\\nPeter Hansen\\nBell Northern Research\\npgmoffc@BNR.ca\\n',\n",

Don\\'t just turn interrupts off, it may\\nprove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other\\ndevices.\\n\\nHere is an example of how to do this:\\n\\n/* ------------------------------ joy.c ------------------------------------- */\\n\\n/* An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port\\n * directly.\\n * Uses inp()/outp() for byte port access.\\n * Will timeout when \\'int count=0\\' counts up to zero.\\n * This sample reads one port (A is presented and B is in the comments).\\n * You can read both at once by merging the two, but it will time out\\n * when either joystick is not connected.\\n *\\n * There is no need to optimize this routine since it runs for as long as\\n * the joystick circuitry needs.\\n *\\n * Written by Eyal Lebedinsky (eyal@ise.canberra.edu.au).\\n*/\\n\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n#include <stdlib.h>\\n#include <conio.h>\\n\\nextern int readjoy (int *x, int *y, int *b1, int *b2);\\n\\n#define JOYPORT\\t0x201\\n\\n#define\\tXJOY\\t0x01\\t/* for joystick B use 0x04 */\\n#define\\tYJOY\\t0x02\\t/* for joystick B use 0x08 */\\n#define XYMASK\\t(XJOY|YJOY)\\n#define\\tBUT1\\t0x10\\t/* for joystick B use 0x40 */\\n#define\\tBUT2\\t0x20\\t/* for joystick B use 0x80 */\\n\\nint\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t/* returns 0 if ok */\\nreadjoy (int *x, int *y, int *b1, int *b2)\\n{\\n\\tregister int\\tcount;\\n\\tregister char\\ttemp, joy;\\n\\n\\ttemp = (char)XYMASK;\\n\\tcount = 0;\\n\\toutp (JOYPORT, 0);\\t\\t/* set trigger */\\n\\tdo {\\n\\t\\ttemp ^= (joy = (char)inp (JOYPORT));\\n\\t\\tif (temp & XJOY)\\n\\t\\t\\t*x = count;\\n\\t\\tif (temp & YJOY)\\n\\t\\t\\t*y = count;\\n\\t} while (++count && ((temp = joy) & XYMASK));\\n\\t*b1 = !(joy & BUT1);\\n\\t*b2 = !(joy & BUT2);\\n\\n\\treturn (!count);\\n}\\n\\n/* This main() is for demonstration.\\n*/\\n\\nint\\nmain ()\\n{\\n\\tint\\trc, x, y, b1, b2;\\n\\n\\tprintf (\"Hit any key to exit\\\\n\");\\n\\twhile (!kbhit ()) {\\n\\t\\trc = readjoy (&x, &y, &b1, &b2);\\n\\t\\tprintf (\"\\\\r%d %3d %3d %d %d\", rc, x, y, b1, b2);\\n\\t}\\n}\\n',\n",

No messing with jumpers necessary.\\n\\n   The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.\\n\\n\\n> 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches\\n>    set but it is much slower.\\n\\na) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM\\n   (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you. \\n \\nb) Dunno.\\n\\nc) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus\\n\\n\\n> 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.\\n\\na) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all\\n   non-interlaced.\\n\\nb) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they\\'ve tested a local bus version\\n   that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.\\n\\nc) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.\\n\\n   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to \\n   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color\\n   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.\\n\\n\\n> 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many\\n>    cases.\\n\\na) They aren\\'t perfect, but are much improved.  I don\\'t recall the last time which\\n   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due\\n   to software incompatibility.\\n\\nb) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.\\n\\nc) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain\\n   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they\\n   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..\\n   other accelerated cards also have bugs.\\n\\nd) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than\\n   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my\\n   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.\\n\\n   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond\\n   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on\\n   the old driver.\\n\\n\\n> 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.\\n\\na) It\\'s quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.\\n \\nb) Yes - I\\'ll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what\\n   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)\\n   every 20 minutes or so...\\n\\nc) Depends on many many things.\\n\\n\\n> 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)\\n\\na) I like it.\\n\\nb) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.\\n\\nc) Yes, this appears to be true :-)\\n\\nd) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are\\n   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.\\n   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer \\n   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was \\n   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)\\n\\n   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.\\n \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThat is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this\\ngroup so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar\\nwith the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don\\'t have\\nan Graphics Ultra yet.)\\n\\nATI Graphics Ultra Plus:\\n- Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours\\n- True colour(16.7M) at 800x600\\n- Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)\\n  Stretch full motion video windows to full size\\n- Fast VGA\\n- Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only)\\n- Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think)\\n- Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop\\n- Around a 1/2 length card size\\n- Priced from $400 U.S.\\n\\nATI Graphics Ultra Pro:\\n- Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus\\n- Faster performance with VRAMS\\n- Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced\\n- Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel\\n- Priced from $600 U.S.\\n\\nATI Technologies\\n(416) 756-0718\\n\\nI hope this summary can be of use to you.\\n\\nAl\\n\\nP.S.

THIS VERSION\\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \\nto contact me.\\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\\n\\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\\n\\n********\\n\\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \\ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \\n\\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \\nof three-dimensional molecules?\\n\\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \\nactually doing it?\\n\\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \\ndo with this package???' , read on.\\n\\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines \\nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \\n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \\nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.\\n\\n\\nEnjoy,\\nChristian Franz\\n\",\n",
